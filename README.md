## Basic Flutter Structure

In the autogenerated main.dart, the main() method calls runApp(MyApp()).
```
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
Below this method, MyApp() is defined as a Stateless Widget and the build method is overriden to return a MaterialApp().
```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
      ...
```
MyApp() is the root Widget of the application. In Flutter, almost everything is a Widget.

## Scaffold Widget

Scaffold is a Widget that provides a basic material design visual layout structure and APIs for a flutter app. Material design is a design language that Google developes and maintains. The Scaffold has many properties. For example, backgroundColor changes the background color, appBar will provide an AppBar, and the body is the where the Widgets within the Scaffold will be placed.

replace all the contents of main.dart with
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Title of Application',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Displayed Title'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
Now when you run main.dart, the App should only display a single static page with only an AppBar with the title "Displayed Title"

## Basic Stateless Widgets

One of the first things to learn about Flutter are Stateless Widgets. A Stateless Widget is a Widget that never changes. Text, Image, and Icon are examples of Stateless Widgets. The other type of Widget is a Stateful Widget. Stateful Widgets can change (for example: when the user interacts with it).
example:
```
Text(
  'New York, US',
    style: TextStyle(
      color: Colors.grey[500],
    ),
  ),
),
```

The Scaffold Widget can display a child Widget. Add the Text Widget to the Scaffold:
```
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('Displayed Title'),
  ),
  child: Text(
    'New York, US',
      style: TextStyle(
        color: Colors.grey[500],
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```
Now when you run main.dart, the App will display a single static page with an AppBar and grey text right below it saying "New York, US"

## Layout Widgets

Layouts are widgets meant to allow you to easily format the UI. The basic Layout Widgets are: Center, Containers, Rows, and Columns.

Center Widget is a layout widget that centers its child within itself.
Container Widget is a layout widgeet that provide common painting, positioning, and sizing for it's child widget.
Row and Column Widgets are multi child layout widgets and allow for multiple child widgets. Rows layout a list of widgets horizontally while Columns layout a list of widgets vertically.

Other layout widgets used here include: Padding, Expanded, and ListView

Padding Widget is a layout widget that insets its child by the given padding, however Containers can also provide padding for it's child widget. If you only need padding, the Padding Widget is fine.
Expanded Widget is a layout widget that expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex to fill the available space on the main axis. It is used as the child of a Row, Column, or Flex Widget.

Example Text Widget inside Container Widget:
```
Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 10, bottom: 20),
  child: Text(
    'Rochester',
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 28,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
  ),
)
```
Since this Container Widget only has padding, you could also use a Padding Widget like this:
```
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 10, bottom: 20),
  child: Text(
    'Rochester',
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 28,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
  ),
)
```

Using a Column Widget inside the Scaffold allows you to show multiple children. Inside the Scaffold Widget, replace the grey text Widget with this layout widget:
```
body: Column(
    children: [
        Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 10, bottom: 20),
            child: Text(
                'Rochester',
                style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 28,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
            ),
        ),
        Text(
        'New York, US',
        style: TextStyle(
            color: Colors.grey[500],
            ),
        ),
    ],
),
```

Now when you run main.dart, the App will display a single static page with an AppBar with bold text saying "Rochester" text beneath it, and smaller, grey text saying "New York, US"

## Defining Widgets Inside build

It is very difficult to read code with so many indents. You can define Widgets outside of the MaterialApp() class.
```
Widget textSection = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 32, top: 8, right: 32, bottom: 16),
  child: Text(
      'Today: Party cloudy currently. The high will be 81\u2109. Mostly clear tonight with a low of 63\u2109.'),
);

...
return MaterialApp(
...
```

the Widget called textSection can be defined inside "build" and before the MaterialApp() class is created. Now, you do not have to repeat code for this particular Container.
Add ```textSection``` directly as a child of the Column Widget inside the Scaffold.

```
body: Column(
    children: [
        ...
        textSection,
    ],
),
```

Now when you run main.dart, the App will display a single static page with an AppBar and 3 other lines of text below the AppBar.

The whole code of main.dart right now is:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    Widget textSection = Container(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 32, top: 8, right: 32, bottom: 16),
    child: Text(
        'Today: Party cloudy currently. The high will be 81\u2109. Mostly clear tonight with a low of 63\u2109.'),
    );
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Title of Application',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Displayed Title'),
        ),
        body: Column(
            children: [
                Padding(
                    padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 10, bottom: 20),
                    child: Text(
                        'Rochester',
                        style: TextStyle(
                        fontSize: 28,
                        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
                Text(
                'New York, US',
                style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.grey[500],
                    ),
                ),
                textSection,
            ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
Using these few Widgets, you can create beautiful static pages for your app!
You can check out the weather_main.dart for an example.
To run a different dart file from the command line, run
```flutter -t lib/[local path to dart file]```

For this applcation, run 
```flutter -t lib/weather_main.dart```
